Vasara
======

Vasara is an Aleph One plugin for texturing maps. The look and feel was developed with Ares Ex Machina, while many of the features (and many lines of code) come from [Visual Mode](http://www.simplici7y.com/items/visual-mode-lua), by Gregory Smith and Jon Irons.

Like Visual Mode on which it's based, Vasara is released under the JUICE LICENSE!, which may or may not actually exist.
